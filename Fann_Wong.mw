At the age of 16, she won a beauty contest organised by ''[[Her World]]'', a Singapore fashion magazine.<ref name="thestar" /> She started a successful modelling career in Singapore, and spent the next two years modelling part-time while taking her [[Advanced Level (UK)|GCE 'A' Level]] examinations at a private school. She afterward earned a diploma in fashion merchandising from [[LaSalle International Fashion School|LIFS]].

Fann moved to Taiwan in 1993. One of her earliest successes was in an [[Oil of Ulan]] (now Oil of Olay) commercial aired in Taiwan and Singapore.<ref name= "thestar" /> The following year, a Singaporean television producer discovered her and cast her in ''Dreams Come True'', a Singapore drama series.<ref name= "thestar" /> Fann soon starred in two more Singapore television series, ''The Challenger'' and ''Chronicle of Life''.<ref name= "thestar" />

<!--===2003: Hollywood===
In 2002, Fann became the first Singaporean actress to play a major role in a Hollywood production as Chon Lin in ''[[Shanghai Knights]]''. When the film was released in early 2003, Stephen Hunter of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' stated:
<blockquote>
Fann is an enchanting new film presence. Clearly modelled after [[Zhang Ziyi]] of ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'', she combines a dancer's grace with a fighter's speed, and looks great standing still or whirling.<ref name="skaccolades">{{cite news | last = Oon | first = Clarissa | title = Fann gets raves; Described as enchanting in her Hollywood debut, Fann Wong is set to act in the sequel to Shanghai Knights | publisher = The Straits Times | date = 2003-02-11 | accessdate = 2006-12-27}}</ref>
</blockquote>
''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'''s David Hunter noted that Fann was "more than equal to playing the strong woman fighter who's also pretty darn cute", while John Keenan of the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' stated that "Fann's stunt work is actually more memorable than [[Jackie Chan]]'s here".<ref name="skaccolades" /> In Hong Kong, the ''[[South China Morning Post]]'' stated that she "seems set to displace [[Lucy Liu]] as [[Hollywood]]'s Asian babe du jour".<ref name="skaccolades" /> She was subsequently nominated under the Best Fight category in [[MTV Movie Awards 2003]],<ref name="bestfight">{{cite web | title = Awards for Shanghai Knights | work = | publisher = IMDB.com | date = | url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0300471/awards | accessdate = 2006-11-26}}</ref> and in 2004, won the Singapore Street Festival's Best International Artiste Award.<ref name="bestintlartiste">{{cite web | title = Fann Wong’s awards | work = | publisher = fannaticfannclub.com | date = | url = http://www.fannaticfannclub.com/achievements/awards.htm | accessdate = 2006-11-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060714214618/http://www.fannaticfannclub.com/achievements/awards.htm--> <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> <!--|archivedate = 2006-07-14}}</ref>
